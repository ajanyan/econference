Review comment :This paper gives a brief idea about the different methodologies in malware analysis. Author has done research in the area of static and dynamic analysis. No novelty is there. Even though the author has mentioned about the tools and techniques used for malware analysis, experiment is not conducted/mentioned. Overall it can be considered for publication.
